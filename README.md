# Aim: To study and implement Recursion
# Software Required:
Visual Studio
# Theory:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a specific base condition is met. A function that performs such self-calling behavior is known as a recursive function, and each instance of the function calling itself is called a recursive call.

<ins>Recursive Function</ins>:
A function that calls itself is called a recursive function. When a recursive function is called, it executes a set of instructions and then calls itself to execute the same set of instructions with a smaller input. A recursive function should contain,
Recursive Case: Recursive case is the way in which the recursive call is present in the function.
Base Condition: The base condition is the condition that is used to terminate the recursion.

<ins>Applications of Recursion</ins>:

Recursion has many applications in computer science and programming. Here are some of the most common applications of recursion:

Solving: Fibonacci sequences, Factorial Function, Reversing an array, Tower of Hanoi.
Backtracking: It is a technique for solving problems by trying out different solutions and undoing them if they do not work. Recursive algorithms are often used in backtracking.
Searching and Sorting Algorithms: Many searching and sorting algorithms, such as binary search and quicksort, use recursion to divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Tree and Graph Traversal: Recursive algorithms are often used to traverse trees and graphs, such as depth-first search and breadth-first search.
Mathematical Computations: Recursion is also used in many mathematical computations, such as the factorial function and the Fibonacci sequence.
Dynamic Programming: It is a technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems. Recursive algorithms are often used in dynamic programming.

# Implementation:
The concept of recursion was understood by the following codes,
+ Factorial using recursion
+ sum of integers using recursion
+ reversal of string and integers using recursion
  
# Concusion:
The above codes demonstrate the concept of recursion in C++
